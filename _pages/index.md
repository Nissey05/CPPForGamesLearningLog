## Introduction

Yo, I'm Nils. I am from the Netherlands and I want to be a Game Programmer. I have always had an interest in Programming, whether it was through an Arduino, LEGO Mindstorms or a Rasphberry PI. However I knew I wanted to become a Game Programmer once we did Python programming for our Computer Science class and due to previous experience in the language, I was tasked with making a game through pygame, the excitement I got from making a very simple, but working concoction of a turn based fighting game I will never forget. After this I tried making some games through Unity with C#, which byfar the most fun was when I was able to code.
