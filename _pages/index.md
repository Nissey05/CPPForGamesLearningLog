## Introduction

Yo, I'm Nils. I am from the Netherlands and I want to be a Game Programmer. I have always had an interest in Programming, whether it was through an Arduino, LEGO Mindstorms or a Rasphberry PI. However I knew I wanted to become a Game Programmer once we did Python programming for our Computer Science class and due to previous experience in the language, I was tasked with making a game through pygame, the excitement I got from making a very simple, but working concoction of a turn based fighting game I will never forget. After this I tried making some games through Unity with C#, which byfar the most fun was when I was able to code.

## Strengths

What are your strengths? What are you good at? Are you good in math? Do you like solving difficult problems? Do you consider yourself a critical thinker? Do you like to work in teams or do you do better as a solo flyer? What will you do to nourish your strengths?

I am quite good at math and solving puzzles. I try to be a critical thinker which helps me in solving puzzles & problems. Depending on the activity I like working both solo and in a team. I can focus on something extremely well, I got the power of autism on my side.

## Weakness

What are you not so good at? What do you find difficult? What do you want to improve about yourself? How do you think you can realize those improvements?

Due to my autism I also sometimes struggle with communication. I also struggle with sound stimuli, I pretty much always wear noise cancelling headphones to prevent getting overstimulated.

## Career Goals

<!---
What do you want to do when you graduate? What role do you see yourself in? Do you want to be the graphics programmer on your team or the gameplay programmer? Or maybe you are more interested in physics programming? Or maybe you'd just rather be the all-in-one guy that can help everyone in your team? Where do you want to work? Be specific! What companies appeal to you? Do you want to work in your home country or abroad? What steps do you need to take in order to acquire this job?

I would like to work at Activision Blizzard if the workplace enviroment there gets better. Otherwise I would like to work at Guerrilla Games or Valve. Before I can achieve this though I need to study game programming better, I intend to do this through the BUAS CMGT Programming Course after the current CPP For Games Course
