This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

During this week, I want to attend the classes at campus which consist of the "Course Introduction" and the "Introduction to C++". Part of this is setting up Visual Studio, Github & learning about fundamental Data types. I also want to start on my design and a Game Design Document (GDD).


## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.
-->

I was able to accomplish all of my goals as they were pretty simple. I learned there are a lot more datatypes than I knew due to all the possible variants of them. I also learned the difference between signed and unsigned datatypes.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->

Travelling to and from Campus went well, following the lectures went well. Some minor issues with setting up the github due to a typo. No current feedback because we havent truly started on programming our game quite yet.


## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

Next week I would like to spend some more time programming.
