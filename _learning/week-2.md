This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

The coming week I would like to learn more about Pointers, References, Arrays, Classes & Functions. This can be achieved through following the classes "Pointers and References" and "Functions & Classes". The first class on tuesday we will be going through Pointers, References & Arrays and the second class on thursday will go over Functions & Classes. I also would like to finish my GDD so I can fully start programming my game.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

I wasn't able to attend all classes at campus due to an accident on the train track. However, I did participate the lecture on thursday online through Microsoft Teams. I have not finished my GDD quite yet due to not having my assets done, however the overarching design for the game is done. 


## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->

GDD unfortunately isn't quite done yet. I did follow the lectures, however we didn't touch Functions quite yet. Instead we spent time actually programming and learning how to use spritesheets and load sprites onto the screen.

Have not really received any feedback quite yet, did give a little bit during the tuesday break.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

I once again would like to spend more time actually programming for the assignment. I also underestimated the time the GDD has consumed.
