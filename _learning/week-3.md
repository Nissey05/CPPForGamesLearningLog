This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

This week I would like to first, finish my GDD. Secondly I want to learn about 'Functions, Templates and STL', this can be achieved through working at home and following the classes at campus or online, ideally at campus. I then also would like to spend more time coding for the assignment and maybe implement movement or a background.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

I was able to somewhat finish my GDD with information I currently have access to, unfortunately I couldn't find any fitting artwork for my game so I will have to add pictures of sprites later. I did attend class at campus on tuesday where we learned about functions and their templates. During the lecture we also added movement, rotation and a reload button. On thursday there were train issues again so I followed from MS Teams, here the lecturer told us about Lambdas & Operator Overloading. We also added a Background through a tilemap and added an Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) to our player sprite.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->

Unfortunately couldn't attend on campus both days, didn't give or receive any feedback this week. I didn't fully understand Lambda functions, so I watched the video back, which was fine. We did not learn about STL this week.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

Overall good week, didn't put out time estimates so can't improve them, but on my guess they were quite alright.
