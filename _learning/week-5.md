This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->
The coming week on the lecture schedule are 'Vectors & Matrices' and Physics, I am very excited for these lectures as Physics is very important for 2D platformers, I also hope we might touch on Algorithms & Random from last week. After the lectures I hope to spend time working on physics for my game.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

First we caught up on Algorithms and also were thought about Ranges & views. After this we worked on improving out player class & implementing the Camera2D class from the framework, this wasnt fully working so we had to fix the camera2d class. On Thursday we started off with a kahoot and this went quite well, I only missed 2 questions. After this we spent the entire lecture doing code lab in which we made a State machine with a map container, made a character turn and we spoke about OOP, inheritance, data duplication and added a Entity Class which is the Parent class of player with which we can handle different types of entities, such as Coins or Enemies. We then also spoke about the Virtual keyword and we added collision between an enemy and player.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

The Tuesday lecture the train was quite delayed and then my drink spilled all over my hardware inside my bag and broke some of it. On Thursday I followed online and we did a Kahoot, this went quite well except for when I missclicked once and brainfarted another question. I did not receive any feedback, but I gave some to a peer because they didnt know how to remove cursor movement from the Input class. I told them what to remove which didn't fully fix their issue because it was also bugged regardless, but did help.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

I would like to continue to improve amount of time spend coding outside of lessons and my overall programming skill.
