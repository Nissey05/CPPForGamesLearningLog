This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->
Coming week I hope to spend a lot more time Programming and adding collisions. Making Sprites & Levels. I also hope we look at more Design patterns. On the schedule are a lecture about Entity-Component System and Finite State Machines. Even though we have covered state machines a little bit using a map container, I hope to learn about other and better ways. Due to trains unfortunately not going at all till December I am planning on attending all classes online.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

On Tuesday we first learned about ECS design patterns such as Event Queues and Ring Buffers, the latter covered a lot about memory handling. After these lectures we looked at Guaravs screen and we looked at how he could implement a way to have an infinite scrolling background with a background sprite cut into multiple pieces. On Thursday we learned about state machines and design patterns to create these. After this we learned about target tracking and following by watching Jetske's screenshare in the code lab. I implemented a background class myself to handle the background & level things. Also fixed bounds of the map, made bounds track AABB instead of player, added enemy class & sprint changes.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

Well unfortunately my goal of attending all classes at campus all weeks didnt work out as trains stopped going the track. I was happy to learn about event queues but found these quite complicated and had to look back a couple time to understand them properly. I did give some feedback during the lecture and helped point some things out.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?

This week I spent more time outside of class working on the assignment, I am very happy about this. I would still like to improve the actual coherence of my code though.
