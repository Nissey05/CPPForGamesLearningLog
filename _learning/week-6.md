This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

The coming week I hope we talk about Vectors & Matrices as we missed it last week. I also hope we go deeper into Physics and how to implement this. The coming week I hope to attend on campus both days for once and I hope to learn about Design Patterns.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

On Tuesday we got a lecture from Bert about the Singleton Design pattern. After this we worked on movement for a 2D topdown game, implementing velocity and direction. We also added worked on implementing the Camera2D class better and moved from a glm::vec2 position to a transform which handles player position which has a lot of premade functions. I also tried adding Gravity. On Thursday we finally talked about vectors, I enjoyed this lecture a lot and I am happy to finally understand vector math. After this I did some screensharing and Jeremiah helped me implement Jumping.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->

This was another positive week, we finally got the lecture on Vectors which was very important to me. There was feedback received from Jeremiah during the coding lab when he looked at my screen to implement Jumping, most of this feedback was implemented. There was no feedback given. 

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?

I am happy with my coding results from this week, I would have liked to implement collisions but I am happy jumping and gravity work.
