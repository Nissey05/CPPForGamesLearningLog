Programming & Feedback

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

This week I want to fix AABBs, my levels and Enemies. I also hope the teacher can give me feedback if I require it during the Open programming/Feedback sessions. 

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

I wasnt quite happy yet with how sprint turned out so I changed it again, I also fixed movement with acceleration & velocity. During the Tuesday lecture we talked about scaled dampening (FPS Independant) on velocity & acceleration when player stops to move. I did a final fix to checkbounds and did a lot of changes to the background class. I also added the list of the levels AABBs (a STL Vector) and got my Enemy class to work. I also made an enemy list and made background own it. Background could be renamed to Level, but that is on a possible TO DO list.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

I got some feedback on Tuesday from Jeremiah regarding FPS independant dampening / Scaled dampening and gave me some articles to read after which I implemented it. Over the weekend I got some feedback from my friend to add a namespace with my collision fixer so I could essentially get any 2 aabbs from anywere and correct their collision. I gave some feedback during the lecture.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?

I want to give more feedback during the lecture instead of only after Jeremiah asks a student to help another student. Also next week is last week and really need to spend a lot more time to get my assignment done in time.
