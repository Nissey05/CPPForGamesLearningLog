Camera, Player Class & STL

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->
This week I hope to work on the Camera and maybe better moving, with sprinting etc. possibly even work on collisions in my project. I want to follow the lectures on algorithms and random, however because we aren't following the exact schedules, I hope we can work some on STL. 

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

I added the functionality that if my character gets to one side of the map in worldspace, the background stops moving and the player can roam around freely and when he goes back the oposite way, player is centered and background moves. I also incorporated a Sprint function. The first lecture was about R-Value References and Move semantics, I did not fully understand it but after watching it back I did. Then we were told about STL. This I did follow and fully understand, I may not remember all the available functions, but I know where to find them. Thursdays lecture was about STL containers and Iterators, the STL containers follows the same as STL, I did understand, but I may not remember it all and I know where I could find their syntax. We also added a Player class and a player AABB.

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

Most stuff went well, I unfortunately couldnt attend thursday at campus once again due to the dutch trains, however following the lecture from home went well. I got some feedback regarding my GDD, I have not given much feedback.
Also we didnt touch random nor algorithms. 

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

I wish to spend even more time programming outside of lecture days, and I hope to improve the code I do write.
