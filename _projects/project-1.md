Pinky's Journey is a game made for the microcredentials course @ Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUAS).  
  
The game is made using C++ and no engine such as Unity, it has however been made using the [Software Rasterizer](https://github.com/jpvanoosten/SoftwareRasterizer) By jpvanoosten. 

I have made the game available on both [Github](https://github.com/Nissey05/SuperCoolCPP4GamesGame.git) and [Itch.io](https://nissey05.itch.io/pinkys-journey).  

Here are some shots from the game
